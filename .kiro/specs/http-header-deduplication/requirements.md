# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The ThinkPHP Runtime extension currently has HTTP header duplication issues, specifically with Content-Length headers appearing multiple times in HTTP responses. This violates HTTP/1.1 specifications and can cause client-side parsing errors, browser warnings, and potential compatibility issues with proxies and load balancers. The issue affects multiple runtime adapters including WorkermanAdapter and potentially others, requiring a systematic solution to ensure proper HTTP header handling across all supported runtimes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using ThinkPHP Runtime, I want HTTP responses to have properly deduplicated headers, so that my application complies with HTTP standards and works correctly with all clients and proxies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any runtime adapter processes a PSR-7 response THEN the system SHALL ensure no duplicate headers exist in the final HTTP response
2. WHEN Content-Length header is set by both PSR-7 response and runtime THEN the system SHALL use only one Content-Length value
3. WHEN multiple headers with the same name are encountered THEN the system SHALL merge them according to HTTP/1.1 specification rules
4. WHEN headers are case-insensitive duplicates THEN the system SHALL treat them as the same header and deduplicate accordingly

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want consistent header handling across all runtime adapters, so that switching between runtimes doesn't introduce HTTP compliance issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN WorkermanAdapter processes responses THEN it SHALL produce deduplicated headers
2. WHEN SwooleAdapter processes responses THEN it SHALL produce deduplicated headers  
3. WHEN FrankenPHPAdapter processes responses THEN it SHALL produce deduplicated headers
4. WHEN ReactPHPAdapter processes responses THEN it SHALL produce deduplicated headers
5. WHEN all other runtime adapters process responses THEN they SHALL produce deduplicated headers
6. WHEN any adapter encounters header conflicts THEN it SHALL follow consistent resolution rules

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and logging for header conflicts, so that I can debug and resolve header-related issues in my application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN header deduplication occurs THEN the system SHALL log the action at debug level
2. WHEN critical header conflicts are detected THEN the system SHALL log warnings with details
3. WHEN header merging fails THEN the system SHALL throw a descriptive exception
4. WHEN duplicate headers are found THEN the system SHALL provide clear information about which headers were affected

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive testing for header deduplication, so that I can verify the fix works correctly across all scenarios and runtimes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running unit tests THEN all header deduplication logic SHALL be covered
2. WHEN running integration tests THEN each runtime adapter SHALL be tested for proper header handling
3. WHEN testing with various header combinations THEN the system SHALL handle all common scenarios correctly
4. WHEN testing edge cases THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle malformed or unusual headers
5. WHEN performance testing THEN header deduplication SHALL not significantly impact response times
